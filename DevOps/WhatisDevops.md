DevOps is a business practice that integrates people, technology, cultural practices, and processes to break down silos and accelerate software delivery. It fosters collaboration between development and operations teams, enabling continuous improvement throughout the software development lifecycle (SDLC). Successful DevOps adoption is often viewed as an organizational shift that enhances agility, efficiency, and innovation in software development.
